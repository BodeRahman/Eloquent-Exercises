/* Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and 
returns a number that indicates how many uppercase “B” characters there are in the string.

Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs, except it takes a second
argument that indicates the character that is to be counted (rather than counting only uppercase “B” 
characters). Rewrite countBs to make use of this new function.*/
